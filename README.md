# BPNN_Constraint_LP
<p>The generated 4D, 6D and 8D constraint functions and their derivation of sensitivity.
<p>The files are given in the .m format. Please use them in the MATLAB environment.
<p>Introduction to Usage: 
        <p> e.g. [y1,fg] = fun_4d(x1)
        <p> % Input: x1 - the vector of 4D lamination parameters.
        <p> % Output: y1 - the value of the constraint function.
        <p> %         fg - the derivatives of y1 with respect to x1.
 
Thanks for your attention. The details can be found in the article: *A general framework for constructing the constraint function of lamination parameters in optimization*
